title: New site!
---

We are doing some really cool work with WebVR here at Mozilla, and with the new site, we wanted to focus on showcasing our ideas, thoughts and projects with the community as much as possible.  So the best thing to do was to blow away the old site and really re-focus the content around the blog posts and content that we create here with WebVR.    In addition to this, we feel that we can provide a lot of help through your first WebVR project and to serve as a hub to the latest news in WebVR.

## Your contributions matter

It's all about you.  The ideas, experiments and thoughts.   We value your work and would like you to be part of the larger discussion.    We invite you to post.


### It's not just about Mozilla

We want to in one place, provide you all the necessary bits you need to get started in VR.
