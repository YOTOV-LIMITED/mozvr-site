A group of high school students at New York's [Innovation High School](http://www.innovationhighschool.org/) attended a three-day workshop to learn how to make WebVR scenes using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).

This workshop was made possible by [Mozilla's Tech Speakers program](https://wiki.mozilla.org/TechSpeakers), presented by volunteer [Rabimba Karanjai](https://twitter.com/rabimba). Rabimba is an active Mozilla volunteer contributor, A-Frame enthusiast, and PhD student at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/).
