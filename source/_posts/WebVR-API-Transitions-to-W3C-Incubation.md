The **[WebVR API][webvr-spec]** has officially begun its transition to the [W3C WebVR Community Group][webvr-cg]!

In finalizing the recent [WebVR v1.0 API spec][webvr1-intro], we formed the **[WebVR Community Group within the W3C][webvr-cg]**. Our goal: to help bring high-performance virtual reality to the open Web through JavaScript-based APIs to access VR devices, sensors, and head-mounted displays.

In 2014, [Vlad Vukićević prototyped builds of Firefox with Oculus Rift DK1 support](http://web.archive.org/web/20151016091437/http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/06/26/first-steps-for-vr-on-the-web), and [Brandon Jones followed with experimental WebVR builds of Chromium](http://blog.tojicode.com/2014/07/bringing-vr-to-chrome.html). Together, they drafted an [informal WebVR API spec](http://web.archive.org/web/20160219163240/https://mozvr.github.io/webvr-spec/webvr.html) that served folks well until earlier this year in March 2016 when we announced the new-and-improved [WebVR v1.0 API proposal](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/03/introducing-the-webvr-1-0-api-proposal/).

## Is WebVR a standard yet?

The WebVR API spec is not yet a bonafide standard. We're hosting all development and discussion of the [WebVR spec][webvr-spec] in the [W3C Community Group][webvr-cg]. (All issues and commits from our old [`MozVR/webvr-spec` GitHub repo](https://github.com/mozvr/webvr-spec/) have been migrated to our new home, the [`W3C/webvr` repo](https://github.com/w3c/webvr/).)

These are significant milestones in getting WebVR one day on the standards track, and we couldn't be more excited! **_But, at the current time, we have not yet started making it a W3C standard._** As a community group, we are beginning to have discussions before committing to a particular standards body.

## How to participate

Feel free to [join](https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/join) the [W3C WebVR Community Group][webvr-cg] (only a [W3C account](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request), not W3C membership, is necessary).

If you'd like to participate in shaping the spec, feel free to [file new issues](https://github.com/w3c/webvr/issues/new) or jump into conversations in [existing issues](https://github.com/w3c/webvr/issues).

To learn more about how the [latest version of the WebVR API works, read this article][webvr1-intro] - and, of course, [the spec][webvr-spec].

For general WebVR information, go to [WebVR.info][webvr-info]. You can also check up-to-date platform status of the WebVR APIs at [IsWebVRReady.org][iwr]. Lastly, you can hop in the [WebVR Slack](https://webvr-slack.herokuapp.com/) to ask questions, give feedback, and hang out with the rest of the WebVR community.
