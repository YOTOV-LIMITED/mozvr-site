[Oculus 0.8 runtime](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/pc/0.8.0.0-beta/Oculus_Runtime_for_Windows/) support has been committed and will be in Firefox Nightly within 48 hours. Please note that this replaces the 0.6 runtime support, so you will need to [upgrade](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/pc/0.8.0.0-beta/Oculus_Runtime_for_Windows/). For Mac OS X users, [0.5 support](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/pc/0.5.0.1-beta/Oculus_Runtime_for_OS_X/) should continue to function as usual.
